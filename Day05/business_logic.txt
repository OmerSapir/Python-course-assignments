In computer software, business logic or domain logic is the part of the program that encodes the real-world
business rules that determine how data can be created, stored, and changed.
It is contrasted with the remainder of the software that might be concerned with lower-level details of managing
a database or displaying the user interface, system infrastructure, or generally connecting various parts of the
program.
